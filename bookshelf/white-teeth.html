    <h2>White Teeth</h2>
    <h3>by Zadie Smith</h3>
    <h4>finished Tuesday, December 27, 2016</h4>
    <!--
      Initial position: Zadie Smith is one of the most relevant voices of post-WWII, post-colonialism, post-immigration, modern culture.

      Argument: Zadie Smith is more than just relevant, she's new: rather than speaking with one particular slang, she strikes a balance between youthful cant and classical eloquence so that her words resonate with all audiences. This is most obvious because of how her words do not come off as ironic, saccharine, schmaltzy, or as anything other painfully extreme sentiment -- they come off as real.

      Notes: I utterly hate my writing can someone save me from myself.

    <p>I took a steady march through White Teeth. I started sometime in the middle of my last semester as an undergraduate student, unwillingly but regularly pushing it aside for pressing academic deadlines. I finally finished the novel during a family-and-friends road trip down in the Deep South. During a sunny noontime, at a rest stop in the middle of South Carolina, I closed the back flap and then group texted the friends who had recommended the book. It had been ages since I had been so drawn into a piece of fiction, so I felt obliged to thank them.</p>

    <p>I am sure that the praise for Zadie Smith is boundless, so I will not waste any time trying to preface my adulation of her. Instead, I will just talk about what I most loved about this work.</p>

    <p>The biggest draw-in for me was Zadie Smith's writing style. Her voice was an amalgamation of a youthful cant and classical eloquence. I never imagined using all-caps'd, mispelled profanities could come off as anything besides edgy in all the wrong ways. But she unironically uses words like "BITCHEZ," without undermining the novel's sophistication. I think her ability to write with a voice that reaches all audiences is best understood through her own words: In a piece for The Guardian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/29/zadie-smith-what-beyonce-taught-me">What Beyonc√© taught me</a>. In this piece, Zadie Smith explores insightful lessons that she has taken from great dancers, specifically how they seem to apply to writing in inspired ways.</p>

    <p>I am grateful that White Teeth reached my life. After four years of awfully technical reading, it gave me a much-needed mental slap that reminded me how much fun reading can be.</p>

    <blockquote>The worst thing is that sometimes you have the instinct to be mean to them, I think it's horrifying the recognize that in yourself. And sometimes you meet a particularly bad child, who's quite boorish or selfish or boastful. Sometimes when I'm with a particularly boastful six year-old and they'll tell me all of the things they own, and then I'll just say, 'Oh well, I, I don't really like those,' which is terrible, and you realize your bitching with a six year-old!</blockquote>

    <p>That's from an interview by the hilarious Adam Buxton; Isn't Zadie Smith just so wonderful?<p>
