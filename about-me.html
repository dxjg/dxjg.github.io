    <p>Welcome to my humble e-abode. My name is David Gong. I am an aspiring
    philosopher, physician, mathematician, astronaut. My scores on JB Peterson's
    The Big Five Aspect Scale are as followed (in percentiles): Aggreableness,
    High (85th); Compassion, Moderately High (66th); Politeness, Very High
    (92nd); Conscientiousness, Moderately Low (35th); Industriousness,
    Moderately Low (27th); Orderliness, Typical or Average (48th); Extraversion,
    Moderately Low (31st); Enthusiasm, Moderately Low (30th); Assertiveness,
    Moderately Low (36th); Neuroticism, Typical or Average (53rd); Withdrawal,
    High (83rd); Volatility, Low (21st); Openness to Experience, Very High
    (94th); Intellect, High (86th); Openness, Very High (93rd). Ultimately, I
    have conflicting feelings regarding trait theory. This theory supposes that
    every person has a fundamental nature that can be roughtly partitioned into
    categories. As appealing as it is to believe that personality can be distilled
    down to a finite number of qualities, this ideology falls victim to the
    simple fact of animal growth. As people grow, and as a byproduct so does
    humanity, their being continues to redefine itself. So from one moment to
    the next, one's 'balance of traits' will inevitably be dissimilar. Not only
    will they differ, but new 'human traits' may arise from never-before-seen
    cultural movements while others may disappear as ideas and beliefs fall out
    of fashion. For this reason, I find these personality profiles to be rather
    benign. But I took one anyway. Enjoy!</p>
