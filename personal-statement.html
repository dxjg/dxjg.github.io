    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>My raison d’être was being shaped and formed before I had even been born, my mother suggests. My mother would call me her tiny philosopher because she had been teaching philosophy to college students when she had been pregnant with me. She said that I must have been listening to her lectures, and that is why, from a young age, I incessantly posed existential questions: Why do this or that? What purpose am I meant to fulfill? Before I can remember, I had developed a vague, but strong and quite utilitarian view of the world: that pleasure is the ultimate good and pain is the ultimate bad.</p>
    <p>As a millennial from a middle-class family, I was privileged to explore the newest recreational technologies. I remember when I was three or four, riding on my father’s shoulders, curious about the large box he was cradling as we walked out of Walmart. This box contained the original PlayStation model; this box would ignite my undying love affair with video games. I discovered endless, unique worlds within every game, where I could get blissfully lost for hours, only stopping at my parents’ warning against this almost "unhealthy addiction.” Aside from the continuous sense of discovery and triumph, I more importantly gained valuable inspiration: I saw technology’s endless potential to improve people’s quality of life—a constant feeling of entertainment was certainly not affordable by the middle class a century ago. Moreover, the advent of the internet enabled the formation of genuine, cross-continental friendships. Early on it became a dream of mine to work with technology and to spread the joy. To me, technology and the internet seemed the be the obvious solution to all strife.</p>
    <p>Growing up I experienced occasional health anomalies that gave substance to my understanding of the importance of health in maintaining a good quality of life. Going through various trials of treatment for chronic canker sores and crossed eyes which I eventually adapted and overcame, I learned of the complexities of human health and the challenge of treating any ailment. I learned of the multi-dimensional effect of health problems on one’s lifestyle: the hindrance in being unable to communicate due to outsized pain from canker sores, the self-consciousness associated with having a crossed eye. There was an occasion when I knocked my two front baby teeth out with a frisbee, and instead of being replaced by two incisors, two molars took their place. I was shocked at the prospect of having two cylinders protruding from the front of my face, but by some unbelievable stroke of luck, I was told that behind this set of wrong adult teeth was hiding a 3rd pair of regular incisors. I was absolutely fascinated by the possible variations of human physiology and the mysteries behind them. At the same time, as I steadily formed connections with people of different demographics from my local community and also traveling abroad in China, my eyes were opened to the vast disparity in accessibility to basic care and necessities let alone technology. There were countless people who were suffering vastly more than I could fathom. I remember meeting a woman with bandaged feet, crippled from the ancient tradition of foot binding, asking me for assistance, and my feeling helpless and guilty for my relatively unimpeded life. I saw the gap between the current state of medical knowledge and technology and what it could be in terms of globally supporting humans’ quality of life was huge.</p>
    <p>But I still remained a loyal believer in the tech industry. Annually, I would attend the Engineering Open House at the University of Illinois, where I saw various research projects and gadgets from speedy combative robots wielding saws to experiments studying the aerodynamics of boat sails to brand new medical tools for robotic surgery or improved assistive devices. A project that particularly stood out to me one year was a hearing aid designed aesthetically to mimic earrings. I remember the presenter argued that eyeglasses, which have always primarily served a clinical purpose, have also adopted a secondary role as an accessory, normalizing their use. Perhaps to combat any stigmas associated with hearing disability, why not adopt the same mentality with hearing aids? For me, this idea, while so obviously simple and perhaps less technologically intricate as other projects at the fair, exemplified the versatility and utilitarian nature of technology that has yet to be explored and implemented.</p>
    <p>Being invited to study Computer Science at Johns Hopkins was a gift for me: to live at an institution recognized for its exploration of technological innovations in medicine. This was my opportunity to learn about pressing issues in humanity and to gain the skills needed to support my hope of bringing technology to those in need. I took a wide variety of computer science courses, firmly believing that by forming a wide skillset, I would be able to effectively tackle any current issue.</p>
    <p>But the classes that really affected me were not at all related to engineering and technology. During the tough times struggling with deciding on my future path as a physician or a technologist, I enrolled in philosophy classes to study my roots, to really learn about the philosophical principles that my mother had instilled in me when I was too young to think for myself. I explored principles of morality, from the teachings of Pre-Socratics to Plato to the more modern philosophies of Emmanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill. And while all of these lines of thought varied intensely on their view of the human soul and society, they all attempted to explain what makes a life “good.” I was finally able to grasp my parents’ motivations to instill in me all of their values of moderation, perseverance, kindness, duty. And what I ultimately was able to do was reaffirm my desire to bring joy to others those who are trapped in their worst state. I hope to have the opportunity in medical school to learn about the most pressing ailments that threaten populations globally so I can utilize technology which has played such a supportive role in my life, to help technology reach its full potential so it can support those who have fewer means to receive treatment in the current costly state of medicine.</p>
